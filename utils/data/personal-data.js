  description: "I'm Sai Sharan Sripada, a passionate Software Engineer and Research Assistant with over 3 years of experience in full-stack development, DevOps, and machine learning. Currently pursuing my Master of Science in Computer Science at the University of South Florida, I’ve maintained a 4.0 GPA while contributing to innovative projects that deliver impactful solutions. In my academic role, I’ve led the development of a Flutter-based app designed to assess children's learning rates and spearheaded a machine learning project that enhanced early detection of psychomotor agitation in dementia using LSTM, improving predictive accuracy by 20%. These experiences have sharpened my ability to blend research with practical implementation. Previously, as a Software Development Engineer II at Zemoso Technologies, I played a key role in creating scalable backend services, implementing CI/CD pipelines, and orchestrating cloud infrastructure using Kubernetes and Terraform. My tech stack includes JavaScript, Python, Node.js, React, GCP, and AWS, making me well-equipped to drive technical excellence across teams. I thrive on solving complex challenges and am eager to apply my expertise to build next-generation solutions that enhance user satisfaction and streamline operations. If you’re looking for a skilled engineer with a passion for innovation and collaboration, I’d love to connect.",
